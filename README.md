For those watching or who have this project starred and are worried that it stopped, don't be afraid! We haven't stopped development, we were simply required to move to a course specific repo located here: https://github.com/Rose-Hulman-ROBO4xx/1314-BeagleBone-Quadcopter.

The quadcopter has achieved flight and we'll be looking for help on improving stability, as well as people to possibly begin some user testing (purchase a kit for parts cost [~50-75] and work on the project in parallel with us). Please email mcdonamp@rose-hulman.edu if interested.
